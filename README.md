## Note:
My first plugin for SCP SL! :D

It was honestly not hard to make it. But I do see how useful this plugin can be in servers.
Currently there is only LabAPI release, but I will be working on an EXILED version for all the EXILED server owners

If there is any issues with the plugin, please let me know in the EXILED Discord server! I will try to fix them as best as I can!


## Plans:
- Might make it more customizable for hiding roles
- I could probably make it so that any event SCP's wont be shown (like the Flamingo's)

I could also make it so that more roles besides SCP's and Tutorial can be hidden from the Spectators or not. But I am also not sure. Tell me if its a good idea or not in the EXILED Discord Server!
